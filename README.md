Screenshots for Activity 5:
The first screenshot shows the initial rebase I made on 'develop' branch with the 'rebase'  branch and the order of commits is c1 -> c2 -> c3 -> c4, as can be seen from the git log

The second and third screenshot shows the rebase where I did the reordering of commits so that c3 becomes the oldest commit and c2 the newest, which makes the order c3 -> c4 -> c1 -> c2
